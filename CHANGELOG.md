# CHANGELOG

We [keep a changelog.](http://keepachangelog.com/)

## v0.4.1

This repository has been extracted from a private monorepo with history, and we will
be backporting CHANGELOG entries.

For now, the current state of the repo contains the source code which was used to
build [v0.4.1](https://pypi.org/project/anaconda-cli-base/) and new releases will be
made from this standalone repo.
